                    <h2>Steps</h2>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>To make the Asian buffalo sauce, combine the ingredients in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>For the ranch sauce, add the ingredients to a large bowl and mix to combine. Add to a small serving bowl and set aside.</li>
                        <li>Cut the chicken wings in half between the wingette drumette. Place chicken onto a tray with some paper towel and generously sprinkle with salt. Leave for 5 minutes to draw out excess moisture.</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, fill a wok or saucepan to about one-third capacity with the vegetable oil. Heat over high heat. The oil is hot enough when a wooden spoon dipped into the oil forms small little bubbles. As your oil is heating, place the cup of cornflour onto a tray.</li>
                        <li>Dust each chicken wing in the cornflour until evenly coated, being sure to tap off any excess. Carefully lower the chicken pieces into the oil (do this in batches if your wok is small) and cook for about 20 minutes or until golden in colour and cooked through. Drain on a rack placed over some paper towel and sprinkle with extra salt</li>
                        <li>Transfer the wings to the bowl of buffalo sauce and mix until each piece is well coated. Empty out on to a serving plate and serve with the ranch dressing on the side.</li>
